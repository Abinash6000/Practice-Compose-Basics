# Compose Quadrant
In this exercise, you need to apply most of the concepts that you learned so far and then go a step further to explore a new Modifier and properties. You need to build an app that displays the information about the Composable functions that you learned.
The screen is divided into four quadrants. Each quadrant provides the name of a Composable function and describes it in one sentence.
